## Content

- This folder serves as a directory where we store information about our system. 
    - .top file 
    - .mdp file 
    - .gro file 
    - .trr and path-.txt files for our configs so that we can start running RETIS
    - `_setup{type}.sh` scripts so that we can setup our path ensemble folders
        - NOTE: Please source these two setup shell scripts. Notice that one script will setup all the plus ensembles, and one will setup the basin ensemble (aka the zero minus ensemble).  

## Special Note

- You will notice that the `*.trr` files are not contained within this directory. The files are too large to be uploaded here.
- Please reach out to sarupria@umn.edu, minhx010@umn.edu, and hall2168@umn.edu for access to these files.
